The RMS Titanic sunk on April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage after colliding with an iceberg, the ship wrekege killed 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

This analysis and predictive model gives an indication of the passengers who were more likely to survive.
